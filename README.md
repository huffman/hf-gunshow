## Concepts

### Code Reuse

#### Data-driven

As you write scripts for High Fidelity you quickly reach a point where you want to reuse previously written entity scripts but with tweaks. Making entity scripts data-driven via `userData` is a natural next-step.

#### Components

### Simulation group

Problem: Multiple agents updating multiple interdependent entity properties on 1 or more entities requires synchronization. If this synchronization doesn't exist there is a risk of inconsistent state.

Example 1:





How are entities grouped in a data-driven manner?
